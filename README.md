# Unit Converter
This program is intended to convert the units cm, in, and ft to meters given the users choice and measurement provided.

## Code to be Improved
- If user enters a solo integer without the unit and presses enter - the program will not produce an error or terminate
- I would like to add functions to clean the code up
- I might re-write the entire program using a do-while and switch statement with functions rather than if statements. Code is messy and confusing for another programmer.
